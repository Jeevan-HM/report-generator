$\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & \textbf{1. Understanding Thermal Imaging} \\
& & & & Please be advised that infrared thermal imaging may be utilized to assess specific areas or systems for potential anomalies. Any indications observed through thermal imaging are always corroborated by supplementary methods, such as a moisture meter, to confirm their presence. The effectiveness of infrared thermography in detecting moisture is contingent upon the actual presence of moisture; therefore, during dry periods, a leak may exist but remain undetectable if the affected materials are devoid of moisture. It is crucial to understand that thermal imaging does not function as X-ray vision, cannot penetrate solid surfaces, and is not capable of identifying mold. \\
$\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & \textbf{2. Scope of the Inspection} \\
& & & & This home inspection constitutes a non-intrusive, visual assessment of the readily accessible portions of the property. Its purpose is to identify significant concerns within specific systems or components as observed and deemed relevant by the inspector at the precise date and time of the inspection. All recommendations pertaining to repair, replacement, further evaluation, or maintenance should be reviewed by qualified trade professionals within your contractual contingency period or prior to the closing date, as applicable. This is essential for obtaining accurate cost estimates for any necessary work and recognizing that these expert evaluations may uncover additional issues beyond what is discernible during a purely visual inspection. This report will not encompass every conceivable issue or defect present but focuses solely on material deficiencies that were visible on the day of the assessment. The inspection aims solely to aid in evaluating the general condition of the residence. It does not forecast future conditions, and the property\&apos;s state may evolve immediately following our departure. Inspectors are not obligated to relocate personal belongings, access panels, furnishings, equipment, vegetation, earth, snow, ice, or any obstructions that impede access or visibility. \\
$\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & $\square$ & \textbf{3. Important Considerations and Disclosures} \\
& & & & It is advisable to review the established Standards of Practice for a comprehensive understanding of the inspection\&apos;s scope.
The findings in this report reflect the observable condition of the property\&apos;s accessible areas solely on the inspection date. The state of components can fluctuate between the inspection date and the date of title transfer. A comprehensive final walkthrough before closing is strongly advised to mitigate unforeseen issues. Acquiring a home warranty is also recommended, particularly if certain systems are approaching or have exceeded their expected lifespan.

& & & & Loose tiles were observed in the master bathroom shower and were reported as a potential safety hazard. Loose or detached tiles can fall or create sharp edges and often indicate compromised substrate or prior water intrusion. It is recommended to discontinue use of the shower until a qualified tile contractor or licensed plumber assesses the condition, secures or replaces loose tiles, and evaluates the underlying substrate for moisture damage or continued leaks. Prompt repair is advised to prevent injury and further deterioration. \\
